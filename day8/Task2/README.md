# Responsive Template Clone with Customization Features

This Task is a **responsive template clone** that allows users to customize various aspects of the page's design, such as the **background background**, **font style**, and **main color**. The user's customization choices are saved using **localStorage**, ensuring that the preferences persist across sessions.

## Features

- **Background Background Customization**: Users can change the background color or image of the page body.
- **Font Style Customization**: Users can select different fonts to change the style of the text on the page.
- **Main Color Customization**: Users can choose the primary color used in the template, affecting buttons, links, and other UI elements.
- **Persist User Preferences**: User preferences (background, font, and color) are stored in **localStorage**, so they persist even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.
- **Responsive Design**: The template is fully responsive and adjusts to various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
